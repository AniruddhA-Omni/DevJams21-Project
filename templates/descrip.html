                <strong style="color: rgb(247, 67, 67);"><u>RESTING BLOOD PRESSURE</u>:</strong>
                Normal: Blood pressure below 120/80 mm Hg is considered to be normal. Elevated: When blood pressure
                readings consistently range from 120 to 129 systolic and less than 80 mm Hg diastolic, it is known 
                as elevated blood pressure.<br>
                <strong style="color: rgb(247, 67, 67);"><u>SERUM CHOLESTORAL IN MG/DL</u>:</strong>
                A person's serum cholesterol level represents the amount of total cholesterol in their blood.<br>
                 <strong style="color: rgb(247, 67, 67);"><u>FASTING BLOOD SUGAR</u>:</strong>
                 A test to determine how much glucose (sugar) is in a blood sample after an overnight fast.<br>
                 <strong style="color: rgb(247, 67, 67);"><u>RESTING ELECTROCARDIAG VALUES</u>:</strong> 
                 records the electrical activity of your heart at rest. It provides information about your heart rate
                 and rhythm.<br>
                 <strong style="color: rgb(247, 67, 67);"><u>ANGINA</u></strong> 
                 a condition marked by severe pain in the chest, often also spreading to the shoulders, arms, and neck, owing 
                 to an inadequate blood supply to the heart.<br>
                 <strong style="color: rgb(247, 67, 67);"><u>FLOUROSOPY</u></strong> 
                 Fluoroscopy is a type of medical imaging that shows a continuous X-ray image on a monitor, much like an X-ray movie.<br><br>

                 <strong style="color: rgb(247, 67, 67);"><u>Exercise induced ST segment depression</u></strong>  is considered a reliable ECG finding for the diagnosis of obstructive coronary 
                 atherosclerosis.  It has also been associated with a worse prognosis for patients with a documented coronary artery disease
                 (CAD).  However, while the diagnostic and prognostic value of ST segment depression occurring during the active phase of 
                 exercise test is well recognised, only a few studies have investigated the clinical significance of ST segment depression 
                 appearing only during the recovery phase of exercise testing.<br><br>
                 The point of inflection at the junction of the S wave and ST segment becomes depressed during exercise, with maximum depression 
                 at peak exercise. The normal ST segment during exercise therefore slopes sharply upwards.<br><br>
                 Thalassemia is an inherited blood disorder characterised by less oxygen-carrying protein (haemoglobin) and fewer red blood cells
                 in the body than normal.Symptoms include fatigue, weakness, paleness and slow growth.Mild forms may not need treatment. Severe forms 
                 may require blood transfusions or a donor stem-cell transplant.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
