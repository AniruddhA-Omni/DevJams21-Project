# Heart Attack Prediction Model

We have made a tool for the prediction of Heart Attack using Machine Learning Model. We have also made a website for the same. The website will take input paramaters related to their health like blood pressure, occurrence of chest pain etc. from the user, and based on it, will provide the output (chances of getting heart attack) from our model on the website.

# Project Details
* We shall train and validate models and develop a machine learning pipeline for deployment.
* We shall build a HTML front end with an input form for independent variables(age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure etc.)
* Build a back-end of the web application using Flask Framework
* 

# Attributes
* age
* sex
* chest pain type (4 values)
* resting blood pressure
* serum cholestoral in mg/dl
* fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
* resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
* maximum heart rate achieved
* exercise induced angina
* oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
* the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
* number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
* thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect
* target:<br /> 0 = less chance of heart attack <br /> 
            1 = more chance of heart attack <br />
THAL = Thalassemia (thal-uh-SEE-me-uh) is an inherited blood disorder that causes your body to have less hemoglobin than normal. Hemoglobin enables red blood cells to carry oxygen. Thalassemia can cause anemia, leaving you fatigued. If you have mild thalassemia, you might not need treatment. <br />
cp: chest pain type <br />
-- Value 1: typical angina <br />
-- Value 2: atypical angina <br />
-- Value 3: non-anginal pain <br />
-- Value 4: asymptomatic <br />
trestbps: resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital) <br />
chol: serum cholestoral in mg/dl <br />
restecg: resting electrocardiographic results <br />
-- Value 0: normal <br />
-- Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)<br />
-- Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria <br />
oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest<br />
exang: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)<br />
slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment<br />
-- Value 1: upsloping<br />
-- Value 2: flat<br />
-- Value 3: downsloping<br />
