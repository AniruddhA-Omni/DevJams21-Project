# Heart Attack Prediction Model

We have made a tool for the prediction of Heart Attack using Machine Learning Model. We have also made a website for the same. The website will take input paramaters related to their health like blood pressure, occurrence of chest pain etc. from the user, and based on it, will provide the output (chances of getting heart attack) from our model on the website.

# Attributes
1) age
2) sex
3) chest pain type (4 values)
4) resting blood pressure
5) serum cholestoral in mg/dl
6)fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
7) resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
8) maximum heart rate achieved
9) exercise induced angina
10) oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
11)the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
12) number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
13) thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect
14) target: 0= less chance of heart attack <br /> 
            1= more chance of heart attack <br />
THAL = Thalassemia (thal-uh-SEE-me-uh) is an inherited blood disorder that causes your body to have less hemoglobin than normal. Hemoglobin enables red blood cells to carry oxygen. Thalassemia can cause anemia, leaving you fatigued. If you have mild thalassemia, you might not need treatment. <br />
cp: chest pain type <br />
-- Value 1: typical angina <br />
-- Value 2: atypical angina <br />
-- Value 3: non-anginal pain <br />
-- Value 4: asymptomatic <br />
trestbps: resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital) <br />
chol: serum cholestoral in mg/dl <br />
restecg: resting electrocardiographic results <br />
-- Value 0: normal <br />
-- Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)<br />
-- Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria <br />
